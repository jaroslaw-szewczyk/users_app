# UsersApp 🧑‍💻

UsersApp is a simple console application created as part of the Kodilla bootcamp. It was designed to help learn the basics of TypeScript in a Node.js environment. The app allows users to manage a list of people via a terminal-based menu.

## ✨ Features

- `list` – show all users  
- `add` – add a new user  
- `edit` – edit an existing user  
- `remove` – remove a user from the list  
- `quit` – exit the app  

## 📦 Technologies

- **TypeScript** – type safety and code structure  
- **Node.js** – runtime environment  
- **Inquirer.js** – interactive CLI menu  
- **Consola** – colored and formatted logging  
- Performance measurement using decorators (`measurePerformance`)
